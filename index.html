  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p class="abtme">
    My name is Donald Trump. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, and
    the best ever President of the United States.
  </p>
  <h2>Early Life</h2>
  <p>
    Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in Queens,
    New York City,[3] the fourth child of Fred Trump, a Bronx-born real-estate
    developer whose parents were German immigrants, and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump,
    an immigrant from Scotland. Trump grew up with older siblings Maryanne, Fred
    Jr., and Elizabeth and younger brother Robert in the Jamaica Estates
    neighborhood of Queens, and attended the private Kew-Forest School from
    kindergarten through seventh grade.[4][5][6] At age 13, he was enrolled at
    the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school,[7] and, in 1964,
    he enrolled at Fordham University. Two years later, he transferred to the
    Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in May 1968
    with a Bachelor of Science in economics.[8][9] In 2015, Trump's lawyer
    Michael Cohen threatened Trump's colleges, high school, and the College
    Board with legal action if they released Trump's academic records.[10] While
    in college, Trump obtained four student draft deferments during the Vietnam
    War era.[11] In 1966, he was deemed fit for military service based upon a
    medical examination, and in July 1968, a local draft board classified him as
    eligible to serve.[12] In October 1968, he was classified 1-Y, a conditional
    medical deferment,[13] and in 1972, he was reclassified 4-F due to bone
    spurs, permanently disqualifying him from service.[14]

  <h2>Political Career</h2>
  <p>
    In 2000, Trump ran in the California and Michigan primaries for nomination
    as the Reform Party candidate for the 2000 United States presidential
    election but withdrew from the race in February 2000.[146][147][148] A July
    1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and
    likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent
    support.[149] Trump, leaning heavily onto a lectern, with his mouth open

    2011 In 2011, Trump speculated about running against President Barack Obama
    in the 2012 election, making his first speaking appearance at the
    Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011 and giving
    speeches in early primary states.[150][151] In May 2011, he announced he
    would not run,[150] and he endorsed Mitt Romney in February 2012.[152]
    Trump's presidential ambitions were generally not taken seriously at the
    time.[153]
